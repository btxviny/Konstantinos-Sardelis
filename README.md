- I gained in-depth knowledge of Computer Vision concepts through implementing and modifying numerous research papers.
- I became familiar with Deep Learning training principles and best practices.
- I used state of the art techniques such as Deep Perceptual Losses, Transfer Learning, feature embeddings and finetuning.
- I used state of the art network architectures and modules such as channel attention, gated convolutions and more.

- I implemented advanced  training schemes such as cGAN, WGAN, Siamese networks and more.
- I learned the best practices for data preprocessing.
- I propose two novel approaches to generate realisticaly unstable videos for supervised training. The first one trains a model to generate realistic motion noise, while the second one generates noise using Principal Component Analysis.

## Projects
